## Technical Highlights (For Technical Writing Evaluation)

In these projects, I demonstrate the following technical writing competencies:
* **Decomposition:** Systematically breaking complex game mechanics and narratives into modular, buildable components.
* **State Management:** Implementing custom look-back algorithms to manage user state and continuity without external libraries.
* **User-Centric Design:** Drafting micro-copy that provides precise emotional feedback and system status rather than generic error codes.
